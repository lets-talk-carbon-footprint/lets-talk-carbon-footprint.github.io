				<u> <b> <center> <h3> Reducing A Carbon Footprint </h3> </center> </u> </b> 

					<center> <p> Did you know that the average American carbon footprint is 16 tons? This is extremely high considering the the global average carbon footprint is only 4 tons. So, we need to reduce our carbon footprint. Reducing a carbon footprint seems like it may be complicated, but <a href="C:\Users\hpfam\OneDrive\Documents\Let's Talk Carbon Footprint Website\reducing-a-carbon-footprint.html">this guide</a> is very straightforward. </center> </p>

				<u> <b> <center> <h3> Experiment on the Carbon Footprint </h3> </center> </u> </b> 
					<center> <p> To gain a better understanding of the carbon footprint, I conducted an experiment. During this experiment I learned a lot about calculating a carbon footprint, and some new questions came up. <a href="C:\Users\hpfam\OneDrive\Documents\Let's Talk Carbon Footprint Website\experiment-on-the-carbon-footprint.html">This page</a> is great to learn about calculating a carbon footprint and my cool experiment! </center> </p>

				<u> <b> <center> <h3> What Is A Carbon Footprint? </h3> </center> </u> </b> 

					<center> <p> The carbon footprint has been talked about a lot in climate change and sustainability. There's even those online carbon footprint calculators. Although, what is a carbon footprint? <a href="C:\Users\hpfam\OneDrive\Documents\Let's Talk Carbon Footprint Website\carbon-footprint.html">On this page</a>, you can learn more about what a carbon footprint is and direct and indirect actions. </center> </p>

				<u> <b> <center> <h3> Outlook on Sustainability </h3> </center> </u> </b> 

					<center> <p> It may seem like the United States is projected to be skyrocketing in carbon emissions for the future, but itâ€™s the opposite. Outlook on Sustainability is all about statistics and projections surrounding carbon emissions. It even features a graph from Our World in Data. <a href="C:\Users\hpfam\OneDrive\Documents\Let's Talk Carbon Footprint Website\outlook-on-sustainability.html">This page</a> is great if your are concerned about the future of our climate. </center> </p>
