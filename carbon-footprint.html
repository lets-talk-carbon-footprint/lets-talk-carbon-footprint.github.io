 					<!-- Second Paragraph-->
					<center class="content-paragraph-font-size"> <p class="push-second-paragraph"> A carbon footprint is generated by our actions, both directly and indirectly. For example, a direct action could be driving a car to work, and an indirect action could be buying meat from a store. Driving a car is a direct action because cars produce emissions and the driver is the person who is responsible for those emissions. They are directly choosing to run a car that produces emissions, maybe even unknowingly. Buying meat from a store is an indirect action because the meat’s carbon footprint is composed of all of the emissions that it took to produce and transport it to the store. So, when someone buys meat, the direct actions to produce and transport it to the store become one’s indirect action, therefore becoming a part of their carbon footprint.</p> </center>

					<!-- First Paragraph-->
					<center class="content-paragraph-font-size"> <p class="push-first-paragraph"> The carbon footprint has been talked about a lot in climate change and sustainability. Although, what is it? A carbon footprint is the number of greenhouse gases that are produced by our actions. Mainly carbon dioxide and methane. </center> </p>

					<!-- Third Paragraph-->
					<center class="content-paragraph-font-size"> <p class="push-third-paragraph"> The average American carbon footprint is 16 tons of C02e (Carbon dioxide equivalent). Which is one of the highest in the world because the global is 4 tons. The global average carbon footprint needs to be under 2 tons by 2050 to avoid a 35.6℉ rise in our climate.
