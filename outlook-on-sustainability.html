 					<!-- Second Paragraph-->
					<center class="content-paragraph-font-size"> <p class="second-paragraph-outlook-properties">Something to note is that the world’s carbon emissions are not evenly spread across the whole world. Relatively developed countries are expected to have no growth in their emissions. Most of the countries that are projected to have higher emissions are not part of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The OECD is an organization that is working to promote policies for the social-well being of people and improve the economy.</p> </center>

					<!-- First Paragraph-->
					<center class="content-paragraph-font-size"> <p class="first-paragraph-outlook-properties"> It may seem like the United States is projected to be skyrocketing in carbon emissions for the future, but it’s the opposite. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projected that U.S. carbon emissions to be lower in 2050 by 4% lower than it was in 2019. Although, the world’s carbon dioxide emissions are expected to increase by 0.6% every year (2018-2050).</center> </p>

					<!-- Third Paragraph-->
					<center class="content-paragraph-font-size"> <p class=""> In conclusion, it seems as though most developed countries are going to have lower carbon emissions in the future. While countries that have fossil fuels as their industry is projected to increase. An example of this would be Russia. In Europe, coal production and consumption have been steadily declining. Which is a good sign for the global carbon footprint. As people, we can help speed up the decline by reducing our own carbon footprint.</p> </center>
