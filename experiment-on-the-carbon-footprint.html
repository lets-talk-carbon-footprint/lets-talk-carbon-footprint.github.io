					<center class="content-paragraph-font-size"> <p class="second-paragraph-experiment-properties"> In my experiment, I first gathered data that is needed to calculate a housing and travel carbon footprint. I collected data over different periods, and I had to consult different sources. Next, I took all of the data and inputted it into an algebraic function that I made for each data set. For example, the function of electricity use is T(m)=0.99m. I took the answer that I got and either multiplied it by 365 or 52 to get the emissions over 1 year.</p> </center>

					<!-- First Paragraph-->
					<center class="content-paragraph-font-size"> <p class="first-paragraph-experiment-properties"> To gain a better understanding of the carbon footprint, I conducted an experiment. My experiment was to find my family’s carbon footprint. I came to realize that calculating the entire carbon footprint would be very difficult. It can be difficult because there are many different variables and different situations to take into consideration. For example, in the food sections there can be up to nine factors to calculate. Instead, I worked to find my family’s housing and travel carbon footprint. </center> </p>

					<!-- Third Paragraph-->
					<center class="content-paragraph-font-size"> <p class=""> 
					Throughout my experiment, I learned how difficult it is to calculate a carbon footprint. There are so many factors that need to be taken into consideration. My goal was to find if my family has a below-average housing and travel carbon footprint. I can say that I proved my hypothesis wrong, because the result was around 674.19 metric tons. Which could be wrong, but it was way off than what I thought it would be. Although, it did bring up some new questions. Below is my full write-up surrounding my experiment. </p> </center>
