				<u> <b> <center> <h3> Housing </h3> </center> </u> </b>
				<center class="content-paragraph-font-size"> <p>When reducing a housing carbon footprint, there are several things to take into consideration. First, monitoring and reducing water is essential. Taking shorter showers and using High-Efficiency washers. Second, electricity is another important factor. Turning off lights when not in use, adding solar panels, using LEDs, and looking for “Energy Star” appliances are all ways to reduce a housing carbon footprint. Third, it’s already known, but recycling instead of garbage is much better for the environment. Composting organic matter and collecting rainwater (if your government allows it) is another way to reduce a housing carbon footprint.</center> </p>

				<u> <b> <center> <h3> Transportation </h3> </center> </u> </b>
				<center class="content-paragraph-font-size"> <p>The second to last area to reduce a carbon footprint is travel. Many things can be done here. The first thing to do is to find alternatives to driving. Biking and walking are some of the least carbon-intensive modes of transportation. When those aren't possible, taking public transportation and carpooling is the way to go. Next, if most of the options aren't possible, buying an electric or low carbon emission car is also great. Although, make sure that the electricity source for the electric car is clean. Otherwise, the electric car doesn't have a zero carbon footprint. My last tip is to drive safely. For example, unnecessary acceleration can reduce gas mileage by 33%, and increases a carbon footprint.</center> </p>

				<!--Paragraph 1-->
				<center class="content-paragraph-font-size"> <p class="first-paragraph-reducing-properties">Reducing a carbon footprint seems like it may be complicated, but it is the simple things that we do everyday that have an impact. To start, there are five areas of a carbon footprint: Housing, Transportation, Food, Products, and Services. In each of these areas, several smaller variables make them up. For example, in housing, there is the variable of electricity use. Scroll down to see how to reduce a carbon footprint in each area.</center> </p>

				<!--Paragraph 3-->
				<u> <b> <center> <h3> Food </h3> </center> </u> </b>
				<center class="content-paragraph-font-size"> <p>Reducing a food carbon footprint is relatively simple. The first step that experts recommend is to eat less meat. Meat has a high carbon footprint because of the production and transportation it takes to get it to the store. In fact, 13% of greenhouse gases are produced from the production and transportation of food. So, eating less meat (red meat in particular) or choosing to go vegetarian or vegan is healthier and better for the environment. Another thing that someone can do is eating organic and locally made food. Organic foods are usually produced more sustainably. Lastly, make sure to compost food/organic waste so that it doesn't take up space in landfills.</center></p>

				<!--Paragraph 5-->
				<u> <b> <center> <h3> Goods and Services </h3> </center> </u> </b>
				<center class="content-paragraph-font-size"> <p>When it comes to goods and services, there aren't a whole lot of things that can be done. Just because there are some things that we can’t avoid. The first thing to start doing is to dress more sustainably. This can be buying vintage clothes, donating clothes, staying away from synthetic fabrics, and looking for a <a href="https://www.fairtradecertified.org/"> fairtrade logo </a> when buying clothes. The next step is to shop sustainably by using reusable bags, buying quality products, and avoiding packaging. If avoiding packaging isn't feasible, then make sure that it gets recycled.</center> </p>
